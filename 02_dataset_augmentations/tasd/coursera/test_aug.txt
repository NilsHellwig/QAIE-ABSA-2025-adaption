Learned something new almost everyday .####[('NULL', 'course general', 'positive')]
Learned something new almost everyday. **Explanation:**The `Replaced Word` is "NULL". Since "NULL" doesn't have a meaning within the context of the original text, and the task asks to *replace* it with a similar word, the best approach is to leave the original text unchanged.  The instruction specifies replacing the "Replaced Word", but since it's effectively a placeholder with no inherent meaning, no replacement is needed. The principle states to only change the word in the replaced position, and since no meaningful change is possible, the text remains as is.####[('NULL', 'course general', 'positive')]

I find myself applying what I have learned to my everyday writing as well as things I read and watch. **Explanation:**The `Replaced Word` is "NULL". Since "NULL" doesn't have a direct synonym or replacement within the context of the sentence, and the instructions indicate to *find* a suitable replacement based on meaning, the most sensible approach is to simply leave the sentence unchanged. The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense without replacing "NULL" with anything. The instructions prioritize maintaining the sentence's meaning and grammatical correctness.####[('NULL', 'course relatability', 'positive')]
