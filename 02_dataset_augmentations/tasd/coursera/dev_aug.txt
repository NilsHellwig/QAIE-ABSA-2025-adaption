Awesome class ! Since the "Replaced Word" is "NULL", and the task is to find a similar word or phrase based on meaning, and "NULL" doesn't have a direct meaning in this context, we can interpret it as a request to simply remove the word or leave it as is, as it doesn't contribute to the sentence's meaning. In this case, removing "NULL" doesn't change the original text. However, since the task asks for *replacement*, and "NULL" doesn't have a meaningful synonym in this context, the best approach is to leave the text unchanged.<Output> Awesome class !####[('Awesome class !', 'course general', 'positive')]

The information was very well presented, with a lot of examples and clear statements.

I'm happy to have discovered it and I would definitely recommend it to others, pure 5 / 5 rating. **Explanation:**The "Replaced Word" is "NULL". Since "NULL" doesn't have a direct synonym or replacement within the context of the sentence, the best approach is to simply remove it as it doesn't contribute to the meaning. The sentence remains grammatically correct and conveys the same information without the placeholder word.####[('NULL', 'course general', 'positive'), ('NULL', 'course quality', 'positive')]

Great class to take if you're a beginner or more of an advanced writer to refresh your learning on the subject. **Explanation:**The `Replaced Word` is "NULL". Since "NULL" doesn't have a meaning within the context of the sentence, and the instructions indicate finding a *similar word or phrase*, and the principle states to replace the replaced word, the best approach is to simply remove it as it doesn't contribute to the meaning.  Removing "NULL" leaves the original sentence unchanged.####[('NULL', 'course general', 'positive')]
