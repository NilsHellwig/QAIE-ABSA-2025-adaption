Okay, I understand the task. Given the original text "Awesome", the replaced word "NULL", and the implementation details, I need to find a suitable replacement for "NULL" that fits the context of "Awesome". Since "NULL" essentially means "nothing" or an empty value, and "Awesome" is a positive descriptor, a suitable replacement would be a positive adjective. Here's the output:**Amazing** **Explanation:**I replaced "NULL" with "Amazing". "Amazing" conveys a similar positive sentiment to "Awesome" and fits grammatically and contextually within the single-word text.####[('Amazing', 'restaurant general', 'positive')]

Okay, I understand the task. Given the original text "Expensive", the replaced word "NULL", and the implementation details, I need to find a suitable replacement for "NULL" that fits the context of "Expensive". Since "NULL" essentially means *something is missing or not specified*, and the context is "Expensive", a suitable replacement would be a descriptor of cost.Here's the output:**Costly**####[('Costly', 'restaurant prices', 'negative')]

I was one of the people who went for this horrible experience. **Explanation:**The "Replaced Word" is NULL, indicating no specific word needs replacement. However, the original text contains the grammatically incorrect phrase "that went".  The correct phrasing is "who went".  Applying the principle of changing only the replaced position (which, in this case, implies correcting the grammar where a replacement is conceptually needed) and ensuring grammatical correctness, I've changed "that" to "who".####[('who', 'restaurant general', 'negative')]
