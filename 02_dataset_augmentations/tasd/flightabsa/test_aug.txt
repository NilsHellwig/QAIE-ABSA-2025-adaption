Disgraceful.####[('NULL', 'airline general', 'negative')]
Disgraceful. Since the "Replaced Word" is NULL, and the instruction is to find a similar word *based on meaning* to replace it, and NULL implies absence of a word, we need to consider the context. "Disgraceful." expresses strong disapproval. A suitable replacement, considering the context and the absence of a replaced word, would be to simply remove the word, leaving a statement of disapproval. However, since the principle states *something* must replace the word, even if it's implied, and the context is strong negative sentiment, we could replace "NULL" with a synonym for shameful or appalling. But since NULL implies absence, the best approach is to maintain the original meaning with a similar intensity.<Output> Shameful.####[('Shameful.', 'airline general', 'negative')]
