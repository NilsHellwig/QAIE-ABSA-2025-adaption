Everyone was more then unhappy with his choices. **Explanation:**The `Replaced Word` is "NULL". Since no word is actually being replaced *with* something, and the instruction is to find a similar word *to* replace it, and "NULL" implies nothing to replace, the original text remains unchanged. The principle states that only the replaced word's position is subject to change, and since there's nothing to change it to, the text stays the same.####[('NULL', 'service general', 'negative', 'unhappy')]
